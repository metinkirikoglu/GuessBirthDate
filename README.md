# GuessBirthDate
This is an old-time game. It's based on binary system.
You have 5 cards that contains numbers from 1 to 31 but every card has different numbers combination.
The cards have their own code which you know. Here are every card' code;
First card --> 1
Second card --> 2
Third card --> 4
Fourth card --> 8
Fifth card --> 16
You ask to your friend is his/her birthday is exists on the card.
Ä°f the answer 'No' there's nothing to do, but if the answer is 'Yes' you add up their codes. 
For example;
Suppose your friend's birthday is 21.
In binary system 21 = 1 + 2^2 +2^4 (1 + 4 + 16)
So your friend will say yes for the first, the third and the fifth cards. You add up their codes  and this is it. You find the result.
In addition, There is no need to memorise every single card's code. The first number of each card is also its code.
When your friend says 'Yes', you should add up the number on the up left-hand corner(the first number on the card).
